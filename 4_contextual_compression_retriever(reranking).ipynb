I originally skipped out on the film as I felt that the trailers only showed an assassin story that I felt I've seen before. As far as I'm concerned, I made a big mistake. Before seeing the sequel, I felt it was important to watch the first one. I rented it on Amazon Prime and I was shock by what I saw; a dark, stylish, and fun action movie that is doing it's own thing. Though I've seen plenty stories about revenge (The Count of Monte Cristo and Moby Dick being the prime examples), I can't recall one over someone's pet being murdered.\\\", metadata={'Author': 'RforFilm', 'Movie_Title': 'John Wick 2', 'Rating': 8, 'Review_Date': '14 February 2017', 'Review_Title': \\\" John Wick: Chapter 2 continues it's faced paced, neo-noir story of our assassin\\\\n\\\", 'Review_Url': '/review/rw3639868/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 6, 'source': 'data/john_wick_2.csv', 'relevance_score': 0.906322}), Document(page_content=': 19\\\\nReview: I really don\\\\'t understand the love that \\\"John Wick\\\" receives.

It takes as much time setting up elaborate action sequences as it does the world with which it all takes place in. And what a world it is. It reminds me of Millers Crossing and it is cooler than any other recent attempt at noir. We are shown a criminal underworld where, if you are connected, many powerful people know who you are and show you respect. John Wick was connected but he got out. He is the rare killer who has found peace, and he is grateful for that peace. Some young kids steal that from him and he does what he does best, he wages a one man war against the Russian Mafia. It might sound like the film takes quite a leap but it all makes sense. The motives of John and the people who get in the way of his bullets are all very clear, even if it does come across as rather simple. That's the plot at it's most basic. Then there's the action. The film is directed by Reeve's stuntman from The Matrix, so this guy knows action. There are sequences that flow so smoothly it puts other action films and their quick cuts to shame. Keaunu moves so fluidly throughout the film and comes across as such a natural that the only disappointment is that we have not seen him like this before. Along the way are plenty of character actors, fans of The Matrix and The Wire will recognize a few people then there are more obvious ones like Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe. Everyone seems to be having a good time. That is another plus for this movie. It get's dark at times but overall it is quite fun, not very chipper, but fun. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I believe it is a must see for action fans and for anyone looking for something a bit different from the usual fare.\\\", metadata={'Author': 'IceSkateUpHill', 'Movie_Title': 'John Wick 1', 'Rating': 10, 'Review_Date': '22 October 2014', 'Review_Title': ' Smoothest action film to come around in a long time\\\\n', 'Review_Url': '/review/rw3109271/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 20, 'source': 'data/john_wick_1.csv', 'relevance_score': 0.8609547})]\"\n",

In fact, this may just pip that one to the post to be the best JOHN WICK yet. The pacing is spot on and the plotting is measured by a huge amount of action sequences, all of which fizz and crackle with skill and energy. The movie hits the ground running as Keanu faces off with a hulking character in a library and then Triads in a weapon shop, but what really amazes here is the sheer inventiveness of the non-repetitive action. There are horse and motorbike chases, a Moroccan brawl with fighting dogs, alongside the massive action of the climax. There also seems to be a greater emphasis on hand-to-hand combat, featuring the likes of RAID actors and old-timer Mark Dacascos, which is a real pleasure as the choreography is top-notch.

No different than a \"Bourne\" or \"Taken\" movie. It gets a slight bump for me in a rating of 6 instead of 5 because I did think that the cinematography was really good and also the fight choreography was top notch. I can definitely see the influence of martial arts films on this.', metadata={'Author': 'xiaoli7377', 'Movie_Title': 'John Wick 1', 'Rating': 6, 'Review_Date': '14 April 2023', 'Review_Title': \" I Don't Get It\\n\", 'Review_Url': '/review/rw8991670/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 19, 'source': 'data/john_wick_1.csv'})]"

       "[Document(page_content=\": 16\\nReview: John Wick 3 is without a doubt the best action movie to have come out in a few years. And its so surprising and refreshing to see that movies like this still exist. Most action movies you see is filled with ridiculous amounts of shaky-cam, fast edits and way over-the-top fights. This is perfect. You can see all action clear as day, and by god the stuns in this film are extraordinary. Why the Academy Awards don't award talent like this is beyond me. There were times that I wondered if they had used CGI, because someone nuts must be willing to throw themselves from motorbikes and through glass. But whatever case it is, its a dam joy to watch.\", metadata={'Author': 'Dannyboi94', 'Movie_Title': 'John Wick 3', 'Rating': 8, 'Review_Date': '16 May 2019', 'Review_Title': \" Finally an action franchise than doesn't lose its touch!\\n\", 'Review_Url': '/review/rw4858493/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 16, 'source': 'data/john_wick_3.csv', 'relevance_score': 0.40727445}),\n",

Is this a film or a video game? On the positive side, it was better than Chapter 2 which is equivalent to being healthier than a leper. Chapter 3 is already advertising Chapter 4 and we can only hope that we'll have stronger characters and a better plot.\", metadata={'Author': 'drjgardner', 'Movie_Title': 'John Wick 3', 'Rating': 4, 'Review_Date': '18 May 2019', 'Review_Title': ' Less is more\\n', 'Review_Url': '/review/rw4862630/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 7, 'source': 'data/john_wick_3.csv', 'relevance_score': 0.39035964}),\n",
